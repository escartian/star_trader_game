The following is a game made in Rust with future plans to have a UI built in react.js allowing the game to be played in a web browser.
The idea is to make the UI look like an email client but actually be a largely text based game.

To run, simply install rust,
in the terminal go to the upper level directory and run
cargo run 

If you want to build but not run you can run
cargo build

If you want to run the unit tests run
cargo test

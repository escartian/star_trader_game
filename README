# Startrader Game as webapp
## In Rust and React

The following is a work in progress game made in Rust with a UI built in react.js allowing the game to be played in a web browser.
The idea is to make the UI look like an "email" client but actually be a largely text based game.

To run, there are two parts the backend and the frontend

For the backend simply install rust compiler (not the game),


In the terminal go to the upper level directory and build the code and then run the code

If you want to build the backend you can run
### `cargo build`

And if you want to run the code you can run it with the following command
###`cargo run` 

If you want to run the unit tests run
###`cargo test`


In the terminal go to frontend directory ( STAR_TRADER_GAME\frontend\ ), there you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
